##SKAJCorp - KvittoSkanner
 
#Getting started
The application is available for download from Google Play.
To run the application on your smartphone you will need the latest update of Android-software.
 
#Project Description
This application is created by four first year students at the Software Engineering program at Chalmers University of Technology as our first Domain Driven design project.
We’ve created an Android-application for smartphones to easily take care of expenses. You take a picture, go through a wizard and within a few clicks you will have archive your  receipt.
You will be able to manage your receipts, add new receipts, edit your already existing receipts and delete receipts. There is also a sort function for you to sort your receipts by date and total price.
You can have several companies and manage them in the same way as your receipts. Add new, edit and delete.
On top of this you can add suppliers for your company, handy if you repeatedly buy certain items at the same place.
