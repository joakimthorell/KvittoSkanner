## Project Description
This application is created by four first-year students at the Software Engineering program at Chalmers University of Technology as our first object oriented project.
We’ve created an Android-application for smartphones to easily take care of expenses. You take a picture, go through a wizard and within a few clicks you will have archived your receipt.
You will be able to manage your receipts, add new receipts, edit your already existing receipts and delete receipts. There is also a sort function for you to sort your receipts by date and total price and the option to filter by category.
You can have several companies and manage them in the same way as your receipts. Add new, edit and delete.
On top of this you can add suppliers for your company, handy if you repeatedly buy certain items at the same place. 

Below is pictures of the GUI. The pictures show the three mainpages of the application where you can take care of all the tasks described above.

To add a new company, receipt or supplier the user should press the action button shown below, this button can be found on all the three main pages. If more than one option is possible, the action button will convert into an action menu.

When using the application for the first time, an intro will take the user through the important information to get started with his/hers bookeeping straight away!
