## Project Description
This application is created by four first-year students at the Software Engineering program at Chalmers University of Technology as our first object oriented project.

We have developed an Android-application to easily take care of business expenses. You simply take a picture, go through a wizard and within a few clicks you will have archived your receipt. 
Users may manage receipts, add new receipts, edit already existing receipts and delete receipts. There is a sort function to sort receipts by date and total price and also the option to filter by category, company or employee.
You can have several companies and manage them in the same way as your receipts: add new, edit and delete.
On top of this you can add suppliers for your company. This comes in handy if you repeatedly buy certain items at the same place. 

Below is pictures of the GUI. The pictures shows three top-level views where you can take care of all the tasks described above.

To add a new company, receipt or supplier the user clicks the action button shown below. This button can be found in all top-level views. If more than one adding option is avaliable, the action button will convert into an action menu.

An app intro will guide users through the important steps for the first use, enabling them to get started with their bookeeping straight away.
